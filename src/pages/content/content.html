        I'm smarter than the av-er-age bear!

    <p>
    Why Is Human Food Bad for Bears?
By eating human food, bears can lose their preference for natural food sources and their fear of humans. Over time, these bears may begin approaching people in search of food. They can become aggressive, unpredictable, and dangerous. Bears looking for human food and garbage can damage property and injure people. These bears pose a risk to public safety and are often euthanized as a result. Studies have also shown that bears that lose their fear of people have a shorter life expectancy than bears that feed on natural foods and are afraid of people. As bears become comfortable around humans, they are more likely to be in areas where humans are. These bears are at risk of being euthanized to protect people, getting hit by a car, and becoming an easy target for poachers.

    There's no words for Beauty like this. Everyone needs to come and spend a week in Yellowstone just to get away from cell phones / electronic. It was nice to be able to use a paper map again. See the beauty of the nature. We seen bison, elk, chipmunks and of course the Old Faithful is a must. Enjoy your time in Yellowstone, I know our family will be coming back.
